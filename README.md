- 👋 Hi, I’m @BobFromTexas
- 👀 This project was added to GitHub as part of my programming course at college.
- 🌱 I was learning Java for my studies and will continue to develop my skills in it. I will also continue to develop
the kniowledge I have built up in C# and ASP.NET; and for good indepth training I like to work on C/ C++ problems too.
Python is also an interest for some other reason and will get to that eventually.
- 💞️ I'm new also to this platform so I have no idea what to do at the moment.
- 📫
