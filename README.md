- 👋 Hi, I’m Kenneth
- 👀 This project was added to GitHub as part of my programming course at college, a course which I completed in 2022.
- 🌱 I was learning Java for my studies and am continuing to develop my skills in it as I wish to transition to the software engineering sector, first as an apprentice, and work my way up through the levels. I love learning how to program and I am using this platform to share how I am doing this, which is through using a textbook and solving the chapter problems problems. 
- 
- For good indepth training I like to work on C/ C++ problems too using the same methodolgy.
- Python is also an interest for some other reason and will get to that eventually.
- 📫
