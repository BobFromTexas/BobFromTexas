- 👋 Hi, I’m @BobFromTexas
- 👀 I’m new to programming and curently finishing a third level course.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java for my studies but would rather focus on C/C++ as this will be required for my new job as a test trainee.
Programming for me is more of an intellectual exercise and I wish to just slowly get to grips with as many aspects of it that I can and eventually as
many languages as I can.
- 💞️ I'm new also to this platform so I have no idea what to do at the moment.
- 📫
